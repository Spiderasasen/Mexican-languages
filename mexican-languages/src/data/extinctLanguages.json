    "description": "In the seventeenth century the Toboso Indians occupied the Bolsón de Mapimí of Coahuila and Chihuahua, and in the following century they frequently raided Spanish settlements to the east in Nuevo León. It is likely that they sometimes crossed the Rio Grande, but records of Tobosos in Texas are rare. However, a few Toboso Indians found their way to Nuestra Señora del Refugio Mission near the Texas coast. Baptismal records indicate their presence at this mission between 1807 and 1828. The Tobosos are frequently identified as Athapaskans (Apaches), but more recent research has produced enough evidence to indicate that the Toboso language was probably Uto-Aztecan."

    "description": "By the 1840s, the Karankawa, now exiled, split into two groups, one of which settled on Padre Island while the other fled into the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. In 1858, Mexican rancher Juan Nepomuceno Cortina led a group of Mexicans and Texan colonists against what was believed to be the Karankawa's last known refuge, killing many. By 1891, the Karankawa ceased to exist as a functioning tribe. Today, however, there are unrecognized tribes who claim Karankawa descent."
