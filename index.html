        <p>Mexico is filled with beauty. From the land to the people, there is nothing the Americas have that Mexico doesn’t. One of the most beautiful things Mexico carries is its languages. Home to 67 Indigenous languages — alongside Spanish — this country speaks in countless voices. Come explore these languages with me, and learn how we can help preserve them for future generations.</p>
