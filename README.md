# Mexican Languages Archive
A project dedicated to preserving and bringing awareness to the Indigenous languages of Mexico — especially those that are endangered or extinct. This site presents accurate data (as of 1/23/26) and highlights why these languages matter.
# Main Layout (HTML/CSS)
The public-facing homepage is built with pure HTML and CSS. This was the first part of the project I completed, and it came together in a single day. It represents the “original world” of the site before React entered the picture.
# React Layout (“Backend”)
This was my first time building anything in React. I created a separate React application to handle the dynamic parts of the project, including the language pages and data-driven components. Learning React under a time crunch was stressful, but it pushed me to grow as a developer.
# Merging Two Worlds
This was the hardest part. I didn’t realize at first that a static HTML/CSS site and a React app are essentially two separate worlds. Trying to merge them caused a lot of debugging issues, and yes — things broke. A lot.
But I learned how to treat each environment properly, how GitHub Pages handles React routing, and how to structure a project so both sides can coexist. After some panic and troubleshooting, everything works.
