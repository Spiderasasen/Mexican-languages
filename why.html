    <p>So, why does any of this matter? For starters, language is one of the main reasons nations, cultures, and even identities exist. The languages we speak today — English, Spanish, French, and countless others — connect us not only to our ancestors but to entire civilizations that shaped the world we live in. Preserving Indigenous languages means preserving the cultures that came before us, including the ones that influenced the cultures we know today.<br><br>
        Keeping these languages alive also exposes us to more than just the dominant languages we hear every day. Instead of a country defined by a single majority language, we can have a nation that reflects the diversity that has always existed here — a diversity many people wish their own countries embraced instead of ignoring.<br><br>
        We can also learn far more from our past. Take Teotihuacan, for example. Because the language of that city is lost, so much of its history remains a mystery. If we had preserved more Indigenous languages, we might understand why their people left, how they lived, and what they believed. Instead of guessing at their religion — like the story of the children and the rabbit who sacrificed themselves so the moon could appear — we could study it with clarity. Just as Greek myths help us understand ancient Greek beliefs, Indigenous languages could help us understand the worldviews of the people who lived here long before us.<br><br>
        When languages die, we don’t just lose words. We lose knowledge, traditions, and entire ways of seeing the world. Letting these languages disappear doesn’t help us learn from the past — it cuts us off from it. It leaves us with gaps we can never fill and stories we can never fully understand. In a way, it’s like closing the door on our own history and expecting to build a better future without the foundation that came before us.
