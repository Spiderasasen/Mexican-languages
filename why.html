    <p>One of the first questions you might ask is simple: why?
        Why does any of this matter?
        The answer is just as simple: preserving these languages means preserving a country’s history, identity, and memory. I focused this project on Mexico — my parents’ home country and my own roots — but even then, I quickly realized how difficult it is to draw clean borders around language. Just like we’ve debated where certain accents come from, languages don’t stay neatly in one place. They move, evolve, and spread across regions and generations.
        Thousands of Indigenous languages in Mexico are already extinct, and many of the ones that remain are on the edge of disappearing. Some, like Ixcatec and Oluteco, have only one or two speakers left. When a language reaches that point, we don’t just lose words — we lose traditions, stories, knowledge systems, and pieces of national history that could have been passed down or recorded. Entire worldviews vanish with them.
        And this isn’t only a Mexican issue. It’s a global one. When we pay attention to endangered languages, we give communities the chance to pass down traditions, preserve cultural memory, and share first‑hand knowledge about ways of life that shaped the world long before modern borders existed. Understanding languages means understanding people — and understanding people means understanding history.
        That’s why I created this website: to bring attention to these languages and preserve what little remains. Some countries, like the United States, are beginning to invest in language preservation, but many others are not. If we want these languages to survive — and the cultures they carry — we need to recognize their value now, not after they’re gone.
